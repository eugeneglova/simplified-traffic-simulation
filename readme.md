# A Simplified Traffic Simulation

Consider a 4-lane traffic junction, controlled by one set of traffic
lights which are located at position 50. When a vehicle reaches the
same position as the traffic lights, it must obey the state of the
lights. If the lights are red, the vehicle cannot move forward. If
the lights are green, the vehicle can move forward. The traffic
lights change every 10 seconds.
 
## Assumptions
 
All traffic is moving in the same direction.
When traveling, all vehicles move at the same, constant speed, of one
vehicle length per second.
Initial vehicle positions are 0, 12, 20, 24 The simulation runs until
all vehicles pass through the traffic lights.

## Solution

- written using pure JavaScript
- function as expected without any defects
- make good use of OO design principles
- represent the type of code that you would produce

## Run

```sh
node app
